"""Shared post-build processing pipeline.

After the core Tree-sitter parse (full_build or incremental_update), four
post-processing steps must run to populate derived tables:

1. Compute node signatures
2. Rebuild FTS5 search index
3. Trace execution flows
4. Detect code communities
5. Compute pre-computed summary tables (flow_snapshots, community_summaries, risk_index)
6. Compute derived edges (CLASS_USES, MODULE_DEPENDS_ON) — on-the-fly, NOT stored

This module extracts that pipeline so every entry point — MCP tool, CLI
commands, and watch mode — produces identical results.
